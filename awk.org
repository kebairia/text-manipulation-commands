First, let's create a file with the following content
#+begin_src sh :results none
  echo "01 02 03 04" > myfile
#+end_src

=awk= command act as a filter

#+html: <details><summary> <b> What i've learned so far </b></summary>
Awk creates a variable for each field (column) in a record (line) ($1, $2 â€¦ $NF). $0 refers to the whole record.
You can print out fields like this:
  
#+begin_src sh
  awk '{ print $1, $2, $7 }'
#+end_src
